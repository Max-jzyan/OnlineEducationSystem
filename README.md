# Online Education system
## Introduction
There is a popular trend on online education these days, due to its time-saving and distance-saving. Most importantly, thanks to my neighber, Shisten, she intoduces me her wonderful idea on her business regarding to online courses and I was quite impressed by her idea. So I would like to invent an simplified online education system facing to users. The main function of this application is getting info about all courses and creating a collection of user's favourite courses. To be detail, the project will be separated into two classes.

    - numberOfComments
    - includeAds
    - ageLimited
- **Methods** in Course 
    - getters
    - setters
    - revisors(adder, subtracter,starCalculater)
